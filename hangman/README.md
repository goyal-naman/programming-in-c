# hangman
A C program to implement the game of Hangman. The user is asked to complete a word by guessing it's letters. Initially, the user is shown a row of dashes, where each dash corresponds to one letter of the word the user has to guess. The user tries to guess the word letter by letter. Every time, the user enters a correct letter (one which is present in the word), the letter is shown at the correct place in the row of dashes. In beginning, the user has 10 points. Every incorrect attempt leads to the reduction of a point, so the user can try at most 10 incorrect letters, after which he loses. If the user completes the word before 10 incorrect attempts, she wins. Implementation details: The words that the game has to use are the following : 1.
